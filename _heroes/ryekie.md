## Notes

"My name's Ryekie! And my other name is... Zap the Justice!! Now then, let us begin the legend of the hero of absolute justice!"

The strongest sales employee in the company where the Protagonist works at; he's a superhero who takes pride in his top-class achievements all around the world.

He originates from a different planet, and because static electricity is constantly accumulated on his body hair due to an innate high electric disposition, all of his clothes are made with insulating materials.

He is a hot-blooded man fully aware and confident in his role as a hero, and because of that, he is always wearing a half-mask that resembles the headgear he wears when he transforms.

His voice is always loud.
