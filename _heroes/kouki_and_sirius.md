## Notes

"I'm Kouki Inukura, and this here is my buddy, Sirius! …huh? The camera isn't rolling? Eh, whatever. Make sure not to be a nuisance in the meantime, capeesh?"

A duo of a child actor and a talented dog who display a wide range of activites centered on global video media. 

Both originate from Nagoya, Japan. Their full names are Kouki Inukura and Sirius, respectively. 

Kouki has risen as a first-class actor thanks to his talent as a performer, acknowledged and esteemed by peers in the field. Because of that, his personality differs depending on wheter there is a presence or an absence of a camera. When a camera is recording he acts as a meek good kid. The second the cameras are off however he lays bare his haugthy and arrogant demeanour. The driving force behind his doings seems to be the existence of a long-lost mother.
