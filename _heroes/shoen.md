A calligrapher who owns a small calligraphy one-room school in Orient City. He is also an educator registered as visiting scholar at university's literature department.

He is an alien from a different world who has devoted his life pursuing calligraphy ever since he became strongly impressed with the culture of japan, the country of earth he first landed on.

Due to his enormous size and the fact that he's taciturn and has an unfriendly face, he tends to come off as scary, but he has an exceedingly gentle personality, He is fond of children

He has a habit of giving folded origami figures to the children he meets.
