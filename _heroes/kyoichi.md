## Notes

"Yo, great work out there! You're going to work today as well, right? I'll come with you! Though, let me just score this test first."

A teacher working at an elementary school in Orient City

An Earthling from Sendai Japan, his fullname is Kyouichi Ootomo

A former senior of Akashi at university, now a teacher who just began his profession

since he originally aim to be a baseball player, he has exceptional reflexes.

Although he possesses the leadership and magnanimity that children idolize, there is a part of him that aggravates things with his younger friends.

By the way, it seems like "Elementary students are the base he's supposed to defend".
