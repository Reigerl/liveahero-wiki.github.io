## Notes

"Ah, you're here. Now then, what kind of mission shall we face today? Rest assured, I won't die easy out there."

The commanding officer of Orient City Fire Department's Hyper Rescue team, always wearing a full face helmet.

Originating from London, England. His full name is Victom Vincent.

Calm and stoic, he is a man who is as much of a life saver as possible, possessing an oustanding situational awareness ability.

Even though he believes that all lives are precious, there is a side of him that follows the saying of "To Live for others, and to die for others", so he tends to look down on his life.
