## Notes

"The brightest star of the northern sky is here! The one who will crush evil and guide the weak! That's right, for I am Polaris Mask! Lead me to the burning ring, Partner!"

A masked professional wrestler who wanders through the universe.

An earthling originating from Sapporo, Japan. His real name is Kensuke Kitakami.

Once a champion who climbed to the very top of the world professional wrestling on Earth, he became unsatisfied with that title alone, and so he embarked towads wider galaxies in hopes of facing fiercer opponents.

Because his positive thinking and excitement are always off-charts, all of his actions and decisions are impulsive and without second thought.

He has a tendency of being in the midst of big-sized tussles, so he is a man who is both a hero and a troublemaker.
