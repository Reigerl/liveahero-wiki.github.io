Gomeisa wears a costume that resembles the costume he wore when he prayed to the sacred tree in his home town, and fights on the battlefield as a dancer hero. However, due to him being a pacifist who hates hurting others, he rarely ever does his opponent any harm. His value comes from the healing crystals made of pure sunlight that are produced on the surface of his body. Through dance, he is able to scatter those crystals around, and any allies that are exposed to said light will be healed.

He hates disputes, loves cute things and wants to get along with everyone. He has the desire to be friends with anyone, dance and play with them, which is why he chose the path that he is on, going to the battlefield for that reason only. He believes that any villain, even Kaibutsu can one day get to know each other and get along with everyone. He dances on the battlefield for peace, hoping that one day that desire will be fulfilled.

Gomeisa is a young giant alien working as a waiter in a place where heroes gather under Procy's management. He is originally from a planet with a civilization that lives with giant trees. He loves dancing and praying to those very same trees and the gods above them. He is innocent, kind, naive and very unsuspecting of others. Having no qualm with being touched, showing no hesitation when asked to undress, causing tons of clumsy accidents due to his massive body; Procy's just at a loss with him.
