A Kendo artist who is a teacher at Hinowa University of Physical Education, serving as an advisor to the institution's kendo club

He is an extraordinary disciplined and rigid warrior, raised in a strict family that has served as knights for generation in his alien hometown.

Although he partakes in spiritual training, he has a short temper and is quite hotheaded, so if you touch his mane, there's a high chance that he will snap.

Because of his personality, which can only be considered as strait-laced, he can't quite express honest feelings of happiness or fondness.

Dare someone tease him and call him a "tsundere" he WILL snap.
