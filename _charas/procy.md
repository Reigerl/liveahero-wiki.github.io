Procy transforms into an unusual hero specializing in making money, born from his strong desire to become a millionaire. The hammer he wields is part of a parallel weapon set, along with a tiny robot that flies around nearby. The robot  tells Procy the most profitable course of action at any given moment, and gives Procy a chance to make a fortune with a hammer that transforms its shape to be more suitable for any given situation.

Born and raised in a poverty-stricken environment in which having a tomorrow was never guaranteed, he lived as a hard laborer in a mine, all while dreaming of becoming a millionaire who could live comfortably. At that time, when the Kaibutsu attacked, the mallet he was carrying changed to a small parallel weapon, and his life changed completely. Realizing he could leverage his power as hero to make a fortune, he bets it all on one big gamble to change his life for the better.

An alien who runs "The Guild of Heroes : Earth Camp", and information exchange center and bar for heroes.

Located near the company where the protagonist works at. Despite looking like a cute little puppy, he's a veteran hero with more than 20 years of career over his shoulder. He is old friends with Ryekie and Huckle.

Although he is caring and open hearted man, his attachment to money is stronger than anything. Ever.

He hates excessive payments and very much prefers get-rich-quick schemes one way or another.

It seems like the bar's opening cost has him up to his neck in debt.
