Dressed in gorgeous and cute stage costumes, she stands dashingly on the battlefield and is active as an idol hero who calls herself "Doki doki Red". By transmitting her own singing voice through a microphone-type parallel weapon, she has the ability to give various effects to the surroundings, such as raising the fighting spirit of allies and neutralizing enemies. The idol-like behavior she has studied thoroughly catches the eyes of many spectators.

For her, a 15-year-old girl, she has a complex about her physical abilities. Despite being cute, she's struggling with her own abilities, which is the opposite of the idol profession that is praised by everyone.  She continues to work hard every day to become a "perfect idol." Despite her delicate position of "it seems to sell but not well known", her hard-working appearance seems to heal and support the hearts of people who are chasing dreams but are frustrated without knowing it.

A half-Earthling and half-alien girl, located in Japan, Earth, to perform idol activities. Born in Hiroshima, Japan. Her stage name is Ayauta Hitomi. A traditional school idol who is lively, friendly, and always does her best.

However, due to the genetic inheritance of her mother, an alien, she has acquired over-engineered physical capabilities for an Earthling. She often loses control of her abilities, so she's very prone to destroying equipment unintentionally. Because of this, she is especially afraid of situations in which she has to touch another person's body, such as handshake events.
