A Nurse Working at a general hospital in the lunar capital.

Because of his gentle and soft personality, he is popular within patients, but because his clumsiness often lead him to question "why does this always happen to me?", he is an oopsie nursie.

Despite this, he can also be useful in the hospital, since he is the only one who can restrain the rampaging doctor, Rakta, who plays an active role as a similar hero.
