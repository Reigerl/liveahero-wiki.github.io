He transforms into a hero that can show off his best performance as a carpenter.  Even in this form, he's still undoubtedly a drunkard, but he can use his split-toe-shoes-shaped parallel weapon to walk vertically on walls, and then, using various tools from his toolbox-shaped parallel weapon, build high quality walls and shelters at a speed that no normal person could do.

In his home town, he was raising a family and living a normal life as a carpenter, when one day a giant monster attacked, bringing disaster and separating him from his family before drifting ashore to Muirauqa IV.  This is when he started drinking daily, and it's also when he began his dream of building a house that could withstand even a giant monster attack.  Consequently, when he sees two lovers or two family members get seperated, he loses his composure, even if they're strangers to him.

He is a diligent man who works as a shipwright in charge of repairs and onboard construction in a shipboard city in the ocean planet of Muirauqa IV. Originating from a different planet, he eventually arrived to Muirauqa IV after wandering.

He is a lewd optimist with a sloppy personality, a heavy drinker, and an irresponsible carpenter that doesn't let go off his bottle of booze even at work. Despite this, he possesses firm arms and dexterous fingers. Contrary to expectations, he can easily assemble blueprints in his head and has the ability to accomplish precise and perfect architecture.
