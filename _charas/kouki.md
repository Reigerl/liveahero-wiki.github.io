Kouki continues to chase after the mother who disappeared from his life. Becoming an actor and, with special approval, becoming a hero are all done in the name of "if I become a big star, she'll find me." However,  despite the many achievements he has under his belt, his mother has yet to appear. It was his partner Sirius who became a hero with the desire to "always stay with Kouki", always snuggling up to Kouki when he becomes anxious.

A duo of a child actor and a talented dog who display a wide range of activites centered on global video media. 

Both originate from Nagoya, Japan. Their full names are Kouki Inukura and Sirius, respectively. 

Kouki has risen as a first-class actor thanks to his talent as a performer, acknowledged and esteemed by peers in the field. Because of that, his personality differs depending on wheter there is a presence or an absence of a camera. When a camera is recording he acts as a meek good kid. The second the cameras are off however he lays bare his haugthy and arrogant demeanour. The driving force behind his doings seems to be the existence of a long-lost mother.
