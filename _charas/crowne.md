A mechanic affiliated with Ramjet: a spacecraft manufacturing company with the largest market share on Earth.

She is an in-house mechanic and spaceship pilot who has a partnership agreement with the company where the Protagonist works at. An Earthling from Seattle, USA. Her full name is Crowne Applefield.

Her arms are as strong as her spirit, and she abhors being treated with contempt "because she's a woman".

Since she's a geek deeply interested in high tech, when she sees rare mechas or robots she has a bad habit of wanting to disassemble them and analyze their structure.
