As an information warfare specialist, the hero he transforms into is armed with a vast hero database, said to be the best in the universe. From his records and memories, he can search for battle data of heroes and Kaibutsu that are closest to the current situation, determine the optimal means of attack, and incorporate it into his own weapon. At first glance, it seems to be an incredibly versatile ability, but if his data on a particular situation is lacking, its performance declines dramatically.。

He pursues information on heroes, villains, and Kaibutsu with a terrifying obsession because of his desire to meet the hero that once saved him. A glorious hero who saved the lives of many citizens and vanished without so much as a name. A phantom who now exists only in Narihito's hazy memories. Chasing after this idol, he puts in his all as a reporter and hero to this day.
